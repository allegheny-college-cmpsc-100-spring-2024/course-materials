## Course Description

### Catalog Description

An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce computational artifacts which address these problems in real-world contexts. Students also learn how to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: None. Distribution Requirements: ME, SP.

### Additional Description

This section of CMPSC-100 uses the VPython library to facilitate a creative and visual approach to learning Python. VPython is a lightweight 3D module that allows students to create three-dimensional image renderings with just a few lines of code. Because this class approaches coding from a creative angle, it emphasizes not just the how of coding but the why behind creating one project versus another.

This class focuses on applications right away, operating on the premise that the ability to write functional code as soon as possible will facilitate future abstract and theoretical understanding. In other words, we approach coding as something best learned by doing. The way computer science is presented often includes a sort of genius mystique that excludes a lot of people. In reality, no one knows everything there is to know about computer science. In addition, programming languages are created by humans with human flaws.

Frustration is part of it. Inside confusion lie the seeds of understanding. The sensation where your brain hurts is a sign that your brain is working, just like a muscle. This class presents computer science as something that is indisputably powerful and useful, but no more rarefied than any other discipline. To write excellent code is a fantastic goal, but ultimately the thing that matters most is what that code does in the world.

### Learning Outcomes

Students who earn a C or better in this course will achieve the following objectives:

#### Scientific Process (SP)

1.  Apply Python programming principles to execute and explain computer code that implements interactive, novel solutions to a variety of computable problems
2.  Release code consistent with industry-standard practices using professional grade IDEs, command line tools, and version control tools.
3.  Analyze and suggest revisions to existing Python language code to improve or add functionality

#### Modes of Expression (ME)

1.  Evaluate the practical and ethical implications of writing computer code and discuss the contexts, perceived effects, and impacts exerted on and by computer code as a cultural force or artifact
2.  Design, describe, and implement original projects incorporating standard practices and Python language principles

## Required materials

### Laptop

A department-approved laptop, with an adequate charge, is required in every class session.

The laptop requirements are avaialable [here](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/#:~:text=Department%20Approved%20Laptops&text=In%20order%20to%20successfully%20complete,10%20or%2011%2064%2Dbit). If you don't have a laptop that meets these specifications, you can request to borrow one using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGS7Z2kMojdCMHe6fp2ovoc5XucCdL1yuynk3wPnK7MiFjDw/viewform). The department has a limited number of loaner laptops available, so the earlier you request, the better!

### Textbook(s)

There are no textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available online or distributed in class.

### Platforms

This course relies on the GitHub, Discord, and Trinket. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

## Assignments

There are five primary types of assignments in this class: exercises, problem-sets, labs, coding challenges, and quizzes. The grading for these assignments are detailed below.

For maximum success in this class, **read all the words in all the assignment instructions**.

## Evaluation

_Evaluation criteria are subject to change, but changes will always be made with notice. Changes may include lateral changes, meaning more grading emphasis will be placed on areas where we've spent more time in class. Any other changes will be in the students' favor._

In this course, you will receive a total out of twenty points that correspond to a letter grade. The first set of criteria are worth two points each. You must achieve _all_ requirements in order to receive points in a category.

### Participation & Expression: Two Point Checkmarks

| Checkmark                | Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Attendance               | Attend at least 80% of class sessions throughout the semseter. If you are late for a session or leave early, this counts as part of one session.                                                             |
| Participation & Teamwork | Participate in class about once a week. Participation can include contributing to Discord threads, speaking in class (answering a question, asking a question), speaking to the professor one-on-one during open work time, and office hours. Receive a teamwork checkmark on at least 1/2 of group assignments. Participate in most group activities. Share at least one lab with the class during the semester. |
| Independent Research and Planning | Receive a planning checkmark on at least 3/4 of lab assignments. Use independent research in at least two lab assignments. |
| Reflection | Receive reflection checkmark on at least 3/4 of lab assignments. |
| Exercises & Problem Sets | Submit attempts for at least 80% of problem sets and 80% of exercises. Pass at least 50% of problem set questions and 50% of exercises. |

### Coding Fundamentals: One Point Checkmarks

To receive a point for a given coding concept, you must correctly answer 50% of quiz questions related to that concept. You must also receive the requried number of checkmarks in the category in labs and coding challenges (see table below).

To get the point for a given concept, again, you must achieve ALL of the described objectives for that concept: lab points, coding challenge points, and 50% correct quiz questions.

| Coding Concept    | Lab | Challenge |
| ----------------- | --- | --------- |
| variables         | 3   | 3         |
| lists             | 2   | 2         |
| while loops       | 2   | 2         |
| for loops         | 2   | 2         |
| math & logic      | 2   | 2         |
| if-else           | 2   | 2         |
| functions         | 3   | 3         |
| dictionaries      | 1   | 1         |
| classes & methods | 1   | 1         |
| terminal commands | 1   | 0         |

### Letter Grade Scale

The following points received out of twenty correspond to the following letter grades:

| Score | Grade  |
| ----- | ------ |
| 20    | **A**  |
| 19    | **A-** |
| 18    | **B+** |
| 17    | **B**  |
| 16    | **B-** |
| 15    | **C+** |
| 14    | **C**  |
| 13    | **C-** |
| 12    | **D+** |
| 11    | **D**  |
| \<=10 | **F**  |

### Grading Process & Late Work

#### Problem Sets & Exercises

Problem sets and exercises will be automatically graded using GatorGrade software, but professor will double check a random subset of assignments to verify the grader's results. GatorGrade results for these assigments can be considred final two weeks after submission.

Occassionally, the grader will incorrectly fail an assignment. If you think this has happened, let me know and I'll address it.

These assignments generally have two deadlines: the initial submit deadline listed in GitHub and the final grading deadline one week later. You should submit a trinket link or push a commit by the submit deadline, but you will have until one week later to pass the assignment objectives for full credit.

Late work is accepted for partial credit up to two weeks after the final grading deadline.

#### Labs & Coding Challenges

Labs and Coding Challenges will be graded using a combination of automated grading and professor's grading. The automated portion of your grade may be posted before the professor has finalized it, and grades for these assignments can be considered final once professor's grading is posted.

Every student can request a one-week extension on up to two coding challenges or labs, no explanation necessary.

Thorough code comments are a critical part of receiving credit for labs and coding challenges. In professional contexts, comments are used more sparingly. In this class, to facilitate learning, you should **document every line of code with comments.** A failure to include these explanatory comments may lead to loss of credit, regardless of code quality.

The professor may also ask you to verbally explain your code in order to receive credit for it.

Every student can request to resubmit up to two individual labs within two weeks of receiving their initial grade.

Group labs won't be granted extensions for coding requirements, as this will affect the whole group. However, you may use one of your individual lab extensions for a group lab's reflection requiremetns.

## Course Policies

### Illness and Wellness, Mental and Physical

**If you think you may be sick, stay home** —- particularly if your symptoms suggest a contagious illness (i.e. cough, fever, sneezing, sore throat). You will ultimately lose more time if you don't allow your body the rest it needs to heal. The class as a whole will succeed better if we make the effort to protect one another from illness. If you experience respiratory symptoms and do not feel you can miss class, please wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth. I will also entertain requests to record portions of class, but make no guarantees.

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

This class is designed with a relatively lenient attendance and deadline policy, in order to accommodate the obstacles that happen in real life (see evaluation section for more details). If you are sick, experiencing an emergency, or you are struggling emotionally, communicate with me about it as early as you can, and we will strategize accordingly. As long as you attend class and do coursework when you are feeling well, there is some space built in for harder times. If you feel overwhelmed even within these structures, you can let me know that too.

If you are dealing with something contagious, or something that requires particular accommodations, feel free to let me know. Otherwise, I don't require details. You can simply let me know that you are struggling and I will believe you. Processing certain details may lie beyond my professional expertise, and I want to do my best to serve you in my capacity as your professor.

Students who are in need of mental health support can access free, confidential services and resources in the Counseling and Personal Development Center (CPDC). CPDC delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student campus community through brief individual and group counseling, crisis support, outreach programming, consultation, and coordination of care. Students may request services by submitting a form on CPDC’s website (sites.allegheny.edu/counseling). Students may also connect with a mental health clinician at any time by calling Allegheny’s 24/7 line: 814-332-2105. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health emergency, please call the 24/7 line, Public Safety (814-332-3357), or 911. When in doubt, reach out.

### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor and technical leaders. Students who need the course instructor’s assistance can schedule an appointment through their Office Hour Calendar near the top of this page. TL office hours are available in the class Discord channel.

### Academic Alerts

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work. It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_ .

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Borrowed Code + Copilot in this class

As an elaboration of the honor code cited above, in this class we have specific policies about borrowed code, as well as AI-assisted code (Copilot).

If you borrow any section of code more than two lines long (even if you modify it), you must link to the code source in the comments and specify where the borrowed code begins and ends. This includes code found online, code from your friends, and even code from class demos. In addition, note the lines you have modified in the code. In certain cases, you may be asked to document what each piece of code does, regardless of whether you borrowed it.

If you use Copilot, you must identify the prompt in your code comments and also delineate the code that came from Copilot and if/how you modified it.

Borrowing code correctly is a big part of being a professional computer scientist, and so it won’t be penalized as long as the code is cited as above and doesn’t constitute more than 50% of your project.

Work that violates the above policy will be dealt with as plagiarism.

### Religious Observance

If you need to miss class or reschedule a final examination due to a religious observance, please speak to the professor well in advance to make arrangements. Please see [https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/](https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/) for more details.

### Educational Accommodations

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at (814) 332-2898. Student Accessibility and Support Services is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please see [https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/) for more details.
